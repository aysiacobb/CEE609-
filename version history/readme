Google Colab offers a revision history feature that allows users to view and track changes made within a single session. This feature is helpful for reviewing the progression of edits during a specific working period but is limited in scope compared to a comprehensive version control system like Git. In Colab, the revision history does not persist beyond the session or provide an ongoing, detailed record of all changes made over time. For example, once a Colab notebook is closed, the revision history resets, making it difficult to fully track the evolution of the code or collaborate with others over extended periods.

For this project, I was the sole contributor, and all revisions and edits were made exclusively by me. Since no collaborators were involved, the changes to the Colab notebook reflect only my iterative updates and improvements. While this ensured consistency in the development process, the absence of a full version history in Colab required extra attention to save significant updates manually or transfer key progress to a more robust version control system like Git for long-term tracking. Despite these limitations, I was able to maintain a clear workflow by carefully documenting and organizing my progress within each session.
